**WPFSpark** is an open source project, which I started in December 2009, with the aim of creating a library of rich user controls which can be used by the developer community. Initially, I ported the Circular Progress Control (which I had developed using C# and GDI+) to WPF. Eventually, as I gained more experience in WPF, I added more controls.

**WPFSpark v1.0** was released in December 2011 followed by **WPFSpark v1.1** in January 2012. Now, after a really long gap of nearly 4 years, I am happy to announce that the next version of WPFSpark is finally released. :) It has been ported to **.NET 4.6** using **C# 6.0**.

## WPFSpark Controls

WPFSpark contains the following controls

###SprocketControl
**SprocketControl** is a circular progress control similar to the Asynchronous Circular Progress Indicator in Mac OS X. It can behave as either normal or indeterminate progress control.

###ToggleSwitch

**ToggleSwitch** control derives from **ToggleButton** and supports only two states: `True` or `False`. This control has been completely rewritten from scratch and provides many properties which allow the user to customize the look and feel of the control (e.g. Windows 10 mobile style or iOS style). Users can create their own customized styles.

###FluidWrapPanel
**FluidWrapPanel** is another control which derives from **Panel** and provides the functionality of a WrapPanel with an added advantage - *the child elements of the panel can be easily rearranged by simple drag and drop*. It has been rewritten from scratch to accommodate children of non-uniform size.

**SparkWindow** is a custom Window which has the look and feel of Windows 10 desktop window with an additional feature : Blur behind (Aero glass effect).

###FluidPivotPanel
**FluidPivotPanel** is inspired from the **PivotControl** of Windows Phone 7/8/8.1.

###FluidStatusBar
**FluidStatusBar** is a custom control used to display status messages to the user. Whenever the status is updated, the previous status message slides out and fades out. At the same time, the new message fades in.
